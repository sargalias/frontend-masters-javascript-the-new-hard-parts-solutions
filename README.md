# Frontend Masters - JavaScript: The New Hard Parts - Solutions

My solutions to the exercises in the course by [Frontend Masters - JavaScript: The New Hard Parts](https://frontendmasters.com/courses/javascript-new-hard-parts/).

The project is extremely simple, having just the JavaScript files and a simple HTML file to be able to see the console.log statements in the console. Nothing fancy except the solutions.

## Source of the challenges

1. Promises - http://csbin.io/promises
2. Iterators - http://csbin.io/iterators

## Running the code

- Easiest way is probably to run the code in each file in your IDE.
  - E.g. with VSCode, install the [Code runner](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=formulahendry.code-runner) extension, then use it to run the code in each file.
- Alternatively open the `index.html` file in a browser, then open the console to see the output.
